            Where to sell fish and meat in Sea of Thieves
          </h2>
          <p>
            Distinguishing from the majority of factions in Sea of Thieves, the
            Hunter's Call is unique in terms of turning in cooked fish. Rather
            than delivering your freshly prepared catches to any standard
            outpost, you must seek out the special seaposts. These small piers
            perched on rocks can be found scattered across the vast map of Sea
            of Thieves. At these specific locations, you can trade in your
            delectable cooked fish for rewards and reputation with the Hunter's
            Call faction. These seaposts provide a quaint and convenient way for
            pirates to exchange their culinary delights and partake in the
            culinary expertise of the sea's bounty.

            At each of these seaposts you can find a representative of the
            Hunter's Call, the faction that you can sell your fish to. They're
            normally standing near the end of the pier, not in the shop.

        <!-- WHAT CAN YOU SELL -->
        <section>
          <h2>What can you sell</h2>
          <p>
            Maximizing the value of your catches is essential when selling fish
            to the Hunter's Call. Cooked fish is particularly lucrative, making
            it a wise decision to utilize the onboard pan on your ship for
            cooking before turning them in. However, caution must be exercised,
            as burnt fish is the least valuable type, even less so than raw
            fish. During the cooking process, it's crucial to monitor the fish
            closely. Watch for the eyes to turn white, as this signifies that
            the fish is perfectly cooked and ready to be removed from the pan.
            Cooking the fish any longer will lead to burning, diminishing its
            value, while removing it prematurely will result in undercooked
            fish. By mastering the art of cooking fish to perfection, you can
            ensure the highest profits when selling them to the Hunter's Call
            faction at the seaposts. Remember, a well-cooked fish is the key to
            reaping the most rewards for your efforts on the high seas.

            Highest Selling Fish In Sea Of Thieves If you're wanting to maximize
            your profit in our Sea of Thieves Fishing Guide, you should always
            try to pursue Rare variants. In addition, you should also cook it as
            this will always return the most money. However, if you burn your
            fish during the cooking process, its value will plummet. Shadow
            Stormfish (Rare variant) currently sells for the most money in our
            Sea of Thieves fishing guide, but only when cooked. Its Trophy
            variants sell for 11,250g raw and 16,875g cooked.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ You
            can sell your fish at Hunter’s Call posts (indicated by the Octopus
            logo), and be sure not to burn them! To sell your fish, you'll need
            to be holding it in your hand, similarly to how you sell chests to
            vendors.

          <h2 id="section-5">FISHING TUTORIAL (for beginners)</h2>
          <p>
            How To Fish 1. Decide your bait. Pull out your fishing rod, re-open
            your inventory and when holding"R"(or B on controller), decide on
            the bait you want. Once it's on the end of your hook, you're ready
            to cast. 2. To cast, simply point at a body of water, and left
            click. To retrieve your line, simply right click. 3. Once your line
            is in the water, it's simply a case of waiting. Sometimes you'll be
            able to see a fish under the water, others it'll be too dark. Either
            way, once you've got a bite your line will begin to flex and bow. 4.
            To reel in a fish when you have a bite, don't instantly left click
            (it'll cause the line to break and the fish to escape). What you
            need to do is tire the fish out. Fundamentally, you move your
            fishing rod in the opposite direction that the fish is moving. If
            the fish is going left, hold right (typically "D"). If the fish is
            going right, hold left (typically "A"). If the fish is going away
            from you, hold down (typically "S"). !!!If you're holding the rod in
            the wrong direction, you'll hear it begin to strain and crack. When
            your line goes slack and when the fish is exhausted, reel it in.!!!
            5. To take your fish off your line, you need to be sure you have the
            inventory space. If you don't have space, you can store items in a
            nearby barrel or eat some existing food.

            How To Cook It's fairly simple! Head below deck and you'll see a
            stove and skillet. If you aren't on board your ship, most islands
            have an available frying pan by any fire. With your fish in hand,
            you'll be able to interact with the pan, and start cooking. Like all
            things in Sea of Thieves, there's no UI to indicate how well your
            fish is cooked. You'll need to pay attention. If it's undercooked
            and you eat it, you'll be sick with food poisoning. Left on the heat
            too long, and it'll be burnt and worthless. While it takes practice
            to know exactly which fish have which timings, the easiest tricks
            are: Watch for the fish to change colour. When it turns brown, it's
            typically cooked just right. The fish's pupils will go completely
            white. Steam coming off the frying pan will thin out as the fish
            cooks through. Larger fish (trophies) take longer to cook.
